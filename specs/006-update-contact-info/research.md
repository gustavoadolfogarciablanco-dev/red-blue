# Research: Contact info updates

## Decision
Update contact info in UI, i18n, metadata, and API to keep all touchpoints consistent.

## Rationale
Users trust contact details shown in multiple places (CTA, metadata, and form fallback). Consistency avoids confusion and misdirected inquiries.

## Alternatives Considered
- Update only the CTA text. Rejected because metadata and fallback would remain outdated.
- Keep the old email in the API. Rejected because inbound leads would be misrouted.
