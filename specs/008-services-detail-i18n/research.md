# Research: Services expansion

## Decision
Add richer service descriptions with bullet highlights and a clear CTA per card, and fully internationalize the new copy.

## Rationale
Detailed service descriptions improve clarity and conversion, while consistent i18n prevents mixed-language content.

## Alternatives Considered
- Keep short copy only. Rejected due to lack of clarity.
- Add a single CTA for the section. Rejected because per-card CTAs provide clearer action.
