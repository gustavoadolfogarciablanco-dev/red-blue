# Research: Header contrast over hero

## Decision
Increase nav background opacity on scroll and add a subtle shadow.

## Rationale
The hero background is high contrast and varied; the nav needs a stronger surface to keep text legible on first scroll.

## Alternatives Considered
- Force solid background at all times. Rejected for design impact.
- Change text color only. Rejected because background varies.
