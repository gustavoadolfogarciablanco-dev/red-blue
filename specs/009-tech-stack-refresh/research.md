# Research: Tech stack refresh

## Decision
Use category filters and richer card descriptions to communicate a professional, enterprise-grade stack.

## Rationale
Filters improve scanning and reduce cognitive load, while richer descriptions clarify differentiation.

## Alternatives Considered
- Keep the simple list. Rejected for lack of depth.
- Use tabs only. Rejected due to limited discoverability on mobile.
