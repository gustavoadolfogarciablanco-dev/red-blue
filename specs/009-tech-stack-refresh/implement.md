# Implement: Tech stack section refresh + filters

## Goal
Deliver a professional tech stack section with filters, richer cards, result count, and full i18n.

## Steps
1. Update HTML for the new layout (header, filters, grid).
2. Add service-aligned filter categories beyond frontend/backend/AI as needed.
3. Add flip cards with official icons centered and titles below (JS, Nuxt, Rust, Nest, Splunk, Amplitude).
4. Add a result count that updates with filters.
5. Add i18n keys for headings, filters, count, and expanded descriptions.
6. Add CSS styles for flip animation, equal heights, and alternating red/blue accents.
7. Apply red/blue icon coloring instead of brand colors.
8. Hide icon containers when logos fail to load.
9. Update section headings/subtitles to use full width on small screens.
10. Remove service card icon containers.
11. Add JS for tap-to-flip on touch plus filter logic with accessible active states, count updates, icon color alternation, and icon load fallback.
